# Benchmarks

Performance cases with recorded baselines (see `docs/design/chemistry.md`,
milestone 10 as implemented, for the numbers and the hardware).

## `chemistry/`: chemistry throughput

`MallardReactor -i <case>.toml` samples states along a constant-volume
ignition (fresh, igniting and burnt gas), replicates them over many cells and
advances them with the solver's chemistry kernels over splitting steps of
1e-8 s (detonations) and 1e-6 s (flames); it prints cells per second and the
sub-step distribution and writes a CSV.

| Case | Mechanism | Species | Reactions |
|---|---|---|---|
| `h2o2.toml` | H2/air, h2o2 | 10 | 29 |
| `gri30.toml` | CH4/air, GRI-Mech 3.0 | 53 | 325 |
| `ndodecane.toml` | n-dodecane/air, Wang et al. (2014) | 100 | 432 |
| `nhexane.toml` | n-hexane/air, NUIG (Zhang et al. 2015); copy it first with `python tools/cantera_mechanisms.py` | 1268 | 5336 |

`[benchmark]` keys: `cells`, `samples` (trajectory states), `dt` (list),
`repeats` (the best is reported, after a warm-up call), `igniting_fraction`
(e.g. 0.01: one igniting cell in a hundred, the others fresh or burnt, to
measure the imbalance between cells), and the execution: `lanes` (vector
lanes per cell, 1 for one thread per cell, 0 automatic), `threads` (team
threads per cell), `shared` (-1 automatic, 0: work memory in global memory)
and `bin_by_cost` (one thread per cell: order cells by their last cost).
`[chemistry] sparse = true/false` chooses the LU (by default sparse from 30 species
when it pays: GRI-3.0 and larger). V3 with the large mechanism: `python tools/v3_check.py
<build>/src/MallardReactor` against `chemistry/nhexane_ignition.csv`.

## `solver/`: full solver

`reactive_shock_tube_2d.toml`: the reactive shock tube (V6) on 960,000 cells
for 400 steps; the run's summary gives the time per cell and step and the
chemistry's share.
